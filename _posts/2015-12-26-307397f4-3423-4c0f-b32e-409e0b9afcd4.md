Martin Heidegger is often presented as the most obscure philosopher of the XX century. Critics and fans tend to label his thinking as the product of an imaginative and saucy language.

This is where you'll discover that Martin Heidegger is, together with Friedrich Nietzsche and Giacomo Leopardi, the most rigorous and accurate philosopher of the modern age, and that his thinking, far from obscure, is as profound and meaningful as well as perfectly intelligible and straightforward for everyone willing to listen to his authentic legacy.
